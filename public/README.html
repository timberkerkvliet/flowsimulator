<h1>Flow Simulator</h1>

<p>
  The flow simulator demonstrates the effects of batch size and WIP limits on software engineering work. More specifically:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Smaller batch sizes lower cycle time.</li>
  <li>WIP limits trade some throughput for a significant reduction in cycle time.</li>
  <li>Maximizing throughput leads to inifnite WIP and cycle time</li>
</ul>
