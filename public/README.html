  <h1>Flow Simulator</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to the Flow Simulator! This tool helps you explore how batch size, collaboration, and WIP (Work In Progress) limits affect cycle time and throughput. 
  </p>

  <h2>What am I even looking at?</h2>

  <p>Great question. Letâ€™s break it down:</p>

  <h3>Unit of Work</h3>

  <p>
    Every letter you see represents a <i>unit of work</i>â€”a tiny, indivisible slice of (customer) value.
    Each color tells you which team member is needed to move that task forward. And when a letter turns black? Itâ€™s done. Cue the celebration. ðŸŽ‰
  </p>

  <h3>In progress</h3>

  <p>
    When units of work are started, theyâ€™re grouped into a <i>batch of work</i>. These batches appear in the left column of the "in progress" area. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Each batch in progress has workers assigned to it. Each batch in progress has one or more team members assigned to it. Each team member is represented by a numberâ€”because itâ€™s simpler for the simulator. But donâ€™t worry, we know theyâ€™re more than just numbers. They have hopes, dreams, and probably strong opinions about coffee.
  </p>

  <h3>Statistics</h3>

  <p>Time for some numbers! Donâ€™t worry, no calculators required.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Avg cycle time:</strong> The average time between starting a batch and completing it. Think of it as the stopwatch for your flow.</li>
    <li><strong>Throughput:</strong> How many units of work get done per time unit. Higher is usually betterâ€”unless youâ€™re measuring stress levels.</li>
    <li><strong>Utilization:</strong> How much of the workersâ€™ time is actually spent working.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Pairing & Mobbing</h3>

  <p>
    Yes, multiple people can work on the same thing at onceâ€”itâ€™s not cheating, itâ€™s collaboration! When two or more workers tackle a batch together, theyâ€™re pairing or mobbing. 
    But collaboration doesnâ€™t happen magically. Workers will only pair up if thereâ€™s no solo work available *and* the WIP limit allows it. 
    Want more teamwork? Lower the WIP limit.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <i>collaboration efficiency</i> slider lets you control how effective collaboration is. 
    At 0, collaboration brings no benefits so the team sticks to flying solo. At 1, it's pure synergyâ€”two people finish twice as fast! 
    The default is 0.8, based on studies that suggest pair programming is about 1.8x as productive as going solo.
